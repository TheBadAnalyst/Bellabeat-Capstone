#### The Task

Here is the scenario. I am a junior data analyst at Bellabeat, focusing on analyzing fitness data from smart devices. My objective is to focus on on gain insights into user behavior, which will inform and refine the company’s marketing strategy. I’ll present my findings and strategic recommendations to the executive team.
